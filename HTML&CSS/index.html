            the world. After she was laid off from her job, she started tagging
            along with him and blogging their experiences at the Everywhereist…
            She says she blogs to help Rand remember where they’ve been and what
            they’ve seen. But this consistently clever site lets the rest of us
            go along for the ride too — even when the couple is just hanging out
