Explain what and how the below command does what it does:

printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80


Your answer:
HTTP/1.1 301 TLS Redirect
Date: Fri, 14 Jun 2019 09:16:58 GMT
Server: Varnish
X-Varnish: 1008833294
X-Cache: cp5008 int
X-Cache-Status: int-front
Server-Timing: cache;desc="int-front"
Set-Cookie: WMF-Last-Access=14-Jun-2019;Path=/;HttpOnly;secure;Expires=Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT
Set-Cookie: WMF-Last-Access-Global=14-Jun-2019;Path=/;Domain=.wikipedia.org;HttpOnly;secure;Expires=Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT
X-Client-IP: 103.211.39.31
Location: https://en.wikipedia.org/
Content-Length: 0
Via: HTTP/1.1 forward.http.proxy:3128
Connection: keep-alive

The above words describe the output of the given command.

Basically, nc stands for netcat which is used to talk to the servers manually. In this, the output of the printf statement is given as the input to the nc en.wikipedia.org website, so that that can return the details of the website like cache status, server timing, set-cookie, location, client IP, content length, connection status (either alive or dead).
